# stock_analysis

Welcome to the README file for our stock analysis project on GitHub! This repository is designed to help investors analyze stocks by providing key metrics and data visualizations that can inform their investment decisions.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have a working knowledge of Python and familiarity with the pandas and matplotlib libraries. You will also need to have an API key from a financial data provider (such as Alpha Vantage) to access real-time stock data.

# Installation
To install this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-analysis.git

Next, create a virtual environment for the project and install the required packages using pip:

cd stock-analysis
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
To use this project, first enter your API key in the config.py file. Then, navigate to the main.py file and update the ticker symbol and time period for the stock you want to analyze. Finally, run the script:

python main.py

This will generate several data visualizations and metrics, including a stock price chart, moving average chart, and daily returns chart.
